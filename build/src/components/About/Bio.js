                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p>I am a recent graduate from The Ohio State University's College of Engineering's fullstack web developement program.  This was a 6-month intensive bootcamp focused on both front-end and back-end developement using languages such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS and SQL.  In addition to the web developement program, I am also in my third year studying computer science through Western Governors University. My focus at Western Governors has so far been on fundamentals such as Network and Security, Database Management Systems and Scripting and Programming C++.</p>
                <p>Currently I am seeking a position as a Junior Web Developer, Software Engineer or any entry level engineering role.  I am currently based out of Columbus, Ohio but I am open to relocation and/or virtual/remote positions.  I aim to start my career while continuing my education.  Aside from work I am typically seen walking my two year-old husky Ronin, wakesurfing, playing in multiple basketball leagues and spending time with friends and family.</p>
